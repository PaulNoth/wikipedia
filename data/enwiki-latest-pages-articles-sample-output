<document><page> <title>Anarchism</title> <abstract>&apos;&apos;&apos;Anarchism&apos;&apos;&apos; is a [[political philosophy]] that advocates [[stateless society|stateless societies]] often defined as [[self-governance|self-governed]] voluntary institutions, but that several authors have defined as more specific institutions based on non-[[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free associations]]. While anti-statism is central, anarchism entails opposing [[authority]] or [[hierarchical organisation]] in the conduct of human relations, including, but not limited to, the state system.

As a subtle and anti-dogmatic philosophy, anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy. Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy. There are many types and traditions of anarchism, not all of which are mutually exclusive. [[Anarchist schools of thought]] can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme [[individualism]] to complete collectivism. Anarchism is usually considered a radical left-wing ideology, and much of [[anarchist economics]] and [[anarchist law|anarchist legal philosophy]] reflect [[Libertarian socialism|anti-authoritarian interpretations]] of [[anarcho-communism|communism]], [[collectivist anarchism|collectivism]], [[anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], or [[participatory economics]].

The central tendency of anarchism as a social movement has been represented by [[Anarchist communism|anarcho-communism]] and [[anarcho-syndicalism]], with [[individualist anarchism]] being primarily a literary phenomenon which nevertheless did have an impact on the bigger currents and individualists have also participated in large anarchist organisations. Many anarchists oppose all forms of aggression, supporting [[self-defense]] or [[non-violence]] ([[anarcho-pacifism]]), while others have supported the use of some [[coercion|coercive]] measures, including violent revolution and [[propaganda of the deed]] as means to achieve anarchist ends.</abstract> </page>
